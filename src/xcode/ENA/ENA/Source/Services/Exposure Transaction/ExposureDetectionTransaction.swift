/// Every time the user wants to know the own risk the app creates an `ExposureDetectionTransaction`.
///
/// The main objective of an `ExposureDetectionTransaction` is to ensure that the
/// exposure detection/risk assesment is done as accurately as possible. An `ExposureDetectionTransaction`
/// requires a delegate to work. The delegate has several high-level tasks:
///
/// - **Provide Information:** Some methods simply provide information/objects that are required by the transaction to do the actual work.
/// - **Consume Results:** At some point the transaction generates results. The delegate is informed about them so that it can consume them.
/// - **React to Errors:** A transaction has several preconditions. If not all of them are met the transaction ends prematurely. In that case the delegate is notified along with a reason that specify details about why the transaction did end prematurely.
///
/// Under the hood the transaction execute the following steps:
///
/// ----
///
/// 1. Determine diagnosis keys that have to be downloaded.
/// 2. Download the missing keys (hours + days).
/// 3. Validate the downloaded data: Check the signatures, decode payloads, â€¦
/// 4. Store everything that is valid and evict invalid/stale data from the local cache.
/// 5. Prepare the actual exposure detection:
///     - Transform keys into a format that can be understood by Apple.
///     - Write transformed data to disk.
///     - Get an `ExposureManager`.
/// 6. Ask for user consent if required.
/// 7. Provide everything to the Exposure Notification framework.
/// 8. Wipe everything and inform the delegate.
