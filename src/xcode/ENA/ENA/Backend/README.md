#  Backed Code

This directory contains code generated by [swift-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf). The code can be re-generated by executing the following command from the root of your working copy:

```
$ ./proto/convert_proto_to_swift.sh
```

This will read all `*.proto`–files in `$root/proto` to `*.pb.swift`–files and write them to `$root/proto/output`. Those files are then referenced from a group called *ENA | Backend* within our Xcode project.

Those files expose classes that de- and encode data that conforms to the corresponding Protocol Buffer schema.

## `DeveloperDiagnosisKeyFileProtobuf.pb.swift`

This file is generated by compiling the schema in `DeveloperDiagnosisKeyFileProtobuf.proto`. `DeveloperDiagnosisKeyFileProtobuf.proto` was copied from the Apple sample code and slightly modified to make it compatible with the latest version of `protoc`. The following changes were done:

- Removed the `optional` keyword since this seems to be the new default.
- Added the version of the required Protocol Buffers language.
